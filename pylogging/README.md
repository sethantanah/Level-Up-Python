### Introduction to Logging

Logging in Python allows you to record information about your application's runtime behavior. It provides a flexible and customizable way to output messages to different destinations such as the console, files, or external services.

### Setting up Logging

find examples in `src` folder.



### Log Levels

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, useful for debugging.
- **INFO**: General information about the application's operation.
- **WARNING**: Indicates a potential problem that doesn't prevent the application from working.
- **ERROR**: Indicates a more serious problem that prevents the application from functioning properly.
- **CRITICAL**: Indicates a critical error that results in the termination of the application.

### Conclusion

Logging is an essential aspect of Python programming, helping you understand and troubleshoot your code effectively. In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of setting up logging, logging messages, and understanding log levels. 

For more advanced logging features and configurations, refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).
